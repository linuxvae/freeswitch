Please do not change the maintainer
Plase DO send me a note before changing anything here and PLEASE DO MAKE A JIRA FIRST !!!!
This is the result of far too much sleepless time and far too many people broke this far too often so HANDS OFF FOR NOW !!!!
So one more time

1. Do not perform any changes before verifying with the current maintainer (yes that is me) if they are OK
2. Before the mere idea of a change shall cross your mind create a ticket in Jira and assign it to the current maintainer
3. Yes the current maintainer has also other obligations besides fixing things people break in the debian build files so be patient, it can sometimes take a bit for him to react.
4. This has been a lot of work so please stay away from fixing it to death
5. The maintainer is always right
6. If the maintainer is wrong, look at 5.
