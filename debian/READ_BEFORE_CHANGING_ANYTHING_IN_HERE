Please do not change the maintainer (as found in the control file).

Please DO send me a note before changing anything here.  Also, PLEASE DO MAKE A
JIRA FIRST !!!!

This request is the result of far too many sleepless nights and far too many
people breaking this far too often.  So, HANDS OFF FOR NOW !!!!

Again, to be perfectly clear:
1. Do not make any changes before verifying that they are OK with the current
maintainer (yes, that is me*).

2. Before the mere idea of making a change crosses your mind, create a ticket in
Jira and assign it to the current maintainer.

3. As current maintainer, I have other obligations besides fixing things people
break in the Debian build.  So, please be patient; it can sometimes take a
bit for me to respond.

4. Creating and maintaining this packages has been a lot of work.  Please help
me maintain it by not fixing it to death.

5. The maintainer is always right.

6. If you believe the maintainer is wrong, please see item #5.
